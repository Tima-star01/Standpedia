  <h1>Welcome, I'm an Aspiring Frontend Developer</h1>

  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    I was born in 2008 and have always had a deep interest in how things work ‚Äî from the rules behind geometry to the logic of code. While I‚Äôm only beginning my journey in frontend development, I approach it with an analytical mindset and strong curiosity. I‚Äôm not afraid to admit that I‚Äôm still learning ‚Äî in fact, I embrace it.
  </p>

  <p>
    I don‚Äôt come from a background filled with achievements or awards. I believe my strength lies in my mind ‚Äî not in memory or observation, but in reasoning. I often question things deeply and prefer thinking in systems rather than memorizing rules blindly. I‚Äôve recently started learning frontend development and I‚Äôm building real projects from scratch using HTML and CSS. JavaScript is next on my list, and I‚Äôm excited to understand how interaction and logic work together on the web.
  </p>

  <h2>Skills and Learning</h2>
  <p>
    At the moment, I work mostly with HTML and CSS. I'm capable of structuring pages, styling layouts, and organizing content clearly. Though my skillset is still growing, I‚Äôm confident that I can create simple but meaningful websites ‚Äî and more importantly, I can learn fast. JavaScript is my next step, and backend development is already in sight.
  </p>

  <p>
    In addition to web development, I speak Russian fluently at a C1 level, which allows me to translate texts, websites, and documentation with accuracy. This linguistic skill adds to my versatility, especially in projects where language and technology meet.
  </p>

  <h2>My Approach</h2>
  <p>
    I‚Äôm not trying to impress anyone with flashy words. I‚Äôm simply someone who wants to get better. I know that learning to code takes time, but I also know that consistency beats talent if applied right. I build things, I make mistakes, and I improve. That‚Äôs how I see progress.
  </p>

  <p>
    I don‚Äôt have a degree or a fancy background ‚Äî just a brain that likes structure, logic, and creation. And I‚Äôm okay with that.
  </p>

  <h2>What's Next?</h2>
  <p>
    Every day I get closer to becoming the kind of developer I want to be. With every project, line of code, and lesson learned, I move forward ‚Äî step by step. Whether you‚Äôre here to see what I‚Äôve made, offer feedback, or collaborate, I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre reading this.
  </p>
<p>
  Aside from coding and logic, I absolutely love watching <strong>JoJo‚Äôs Bizarre Adventure</strong>. It‚Äôs not just an anime ‚Äî it‚Äôs a whole state of mind. JoJo inspires me to create my own world, where every Stand reflects a piece of inner character and purpose.
</p>
<p>
    Let‚Äôs build something smart.
