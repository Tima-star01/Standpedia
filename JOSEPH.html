  <h1>Joseph Joestar</h1>
  <h2>Hermit Purple • Ripple Genius</h2>

  <p>
    Grandson of Jonathan Joestar, <strong>Joseph</strong> inherits the Joestar will — but expresses it in a completely different way.
    Unlike his noble and disciplined grandfather, Joseph is unpredictable, cunning, sarcastic, and wildly clever.
  </p>

  <div class="section">
    <strong>Stand:</strong> <em>Hermit Purple</em><br/>
    Hermit Purple is a vine-like Stand that manifests from Joseph’s hands. It allows for psychic photographs (Spirit Photography), long-range energy transmission, and even movement via grappling.
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <strong>Ability:</strong> Ripple (Hamon)<br/>
    Joseph is possibly the <strong>last living master of Ripple</strong>. His Hamon skills are creative and chaotic — using bottlecaps, clackers, even a pair of headphones as Hamon conductors. His mastery proves how far Ripple can evolve in the hands of a genius.
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <strong>Mind & Tactics:</strong><br/>
    Joseph’s greatest weapon is his <strong>intelligence and intuition</strong>. He can predict enemy behavior, foresee what others will say, and craft plans within seconds.  
    His signature move: <em>"Your next line is..."</em> — is more than a catchphrase. It’s a psychological blow.
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <strong>Philosophy of Combat:</strong><br/>
    Despite his wild nature, Joseph respects his enemies and mourns the fall of worthy opponents. He believes in tactical survival over blind bravery.  
    He created the legendary <strong>"Plan B"</strong>: when the situation turns bad — run, regroup, and outsmart!
  </div>

  <div class="quote">
    “Your next line is... ‘How the hell did he know that?!’”
  </div>

  <div class="quote">
    “Running away can be the smartest thing a man does. Especially if it saves lives.”
